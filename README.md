This project creates a flexible Python tool to analyze the sentiment of company earnings call transcripts and see how it affects stock prices. It uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) and financial data to deliver clear, reliable results. First, it cleans up raw transcripts and pairs them with market data, like stock prices and trading volume, timed around the earnings call.

The tool then applies three top sentiment analysis methods—VADER, FinBERT, and Loughran-McDonald—to gauge the tone of management’s words. These sentiment scores are combined with financial metrics to reveal how the call’s tone impacts stock performance.

Results are displayed in easy-to-read charts and summarized for reports. The project is built in a modular way, with separate parts for data prep, sentiment analysis, financial integration, and visualization, making it easy to use, adapt, and scale. It’s a practical, well-structured tool for financial research and investing.
